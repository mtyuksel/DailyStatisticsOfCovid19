This program gets data from a source on the internet as a JSON file and parses the captured data. It classifies this data appropriately using different functions. It creates graphic interfaces with the data sets it has classified. These graphic interfaces are in the form of bar charts, line charts, and tables.

In summary, the main function of the program is to collect COVID data from the internet and present it to the user in graphs.
